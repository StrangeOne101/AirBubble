# Description
AirBubble allows the bender to bring air pockets into water. This allows them to breath underwater while they hold it!

# Instructions
Hold sneak when above water to push the water back and create an air bubble. Alternatively, you can click to create a bubble for a short amount of time.

Unlike WaterBubble, there is no config option to activate it underwater. You must be in air to activate it.
